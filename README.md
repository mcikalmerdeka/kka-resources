# Koding dan Kecerdasan Artificial Repository

This repository is dedicated to the analysis and implementation of the new education curriculum for "Koding dan Kecerdasan Artificial" (Coding and Artificial Intelligence). It serves as a comprehensive resource for educators, students, and developers interested in integrating coding and AI concepts into educational frameworks, particularly for high school (SMA) levels.

## Purpose

- **Analysis**: Examine the curriculum guidelines and reference materials to understand the structure and requirements.
- **Implementation**: Provide practical coding examples, projects, and implementations based on the curriculum.
- **Resources**: Include educational materials, code snippets, and AI-related experiments to support learning.

## Reference Materials

The `reference/` folder contains key documents used for analysis:

- BUKU AI SMA Kelas 10 Semester 1.pdf
- BUKU AI SMA Kelas 10 Semester 2.pdf
- BUKU AI SMA Kelas 11 Semester 1.pdf
- BUKU AI SMA Kelas 11 Semester 2.pdf
- BUKU AI SMA Kelas 12 Semester 1.pdf

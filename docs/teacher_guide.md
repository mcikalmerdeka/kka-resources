## Teaching Strategies

### Socratic Method with AI

1. **Don't give direct answers**: Let students explore
2. **Ask guiding questions**: "What do you think will happen if...?"
3. **Encourage iteration**: "How can we improve this prompt?"

### Critical Thinking Framework

Teach students to evaluate AI outputs:

1. **Accuracy**: Is this information correct?
2. **Completeness**: What's missing?
3. **Bias**: Does this reflect a particular perspective?
4. **Usefulness**: Does this actually help me learn?

### Collaborative Learning

- **Pair Programming**: Two students, one AI tool
- **Group Discussions**: Share interesting AI responses
- **Class Challenges**: Who can get the best prompt?
